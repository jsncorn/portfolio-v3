            <span class='card-text'>Born in August of 2003, I'm still considered a fresh, young mind.
                Despite being what others consider young, I have had a considerable amount of experiences in
                work environments. However, my experiences are not the only qualities I own.</span>
            <br>
            <span class='card-text'>I began coding in 2016 (yes, I know, I was super young). The reason
                I was so interested in coding was because of a video game I played. Because of this, I attempted
                to make a mod for said video game (written in Java). Through this sudden interest,
                I scoured the internet and self-taught myself on enough Java to finish my mini coding project.
                Safe to say, I was addicted to both the game and the code. Eventually, I took a break from coding as I
                did not have a guide and ended up
                not know what else to learn about.</span>
            <br>
            <span class='card-text'>
                In 2017, I began my coding passion again. This time, it would not be self-taught.
                My school provided a small pool of computer science classes. I began my first class
                in my sophomore year: Intro to Java. My prior experience helped me pass this class with breeze.
                So what next? I took another class - two classes actually. I ended up taking AP Computer Science
                Principles
                and Intro to Python. While Python was similar to Java, it would be a new language that I rather enjoyed
                learning
                and experimenting with. I ended up (independently) making a Python project that grabbed
                faculty member's info using user input. That is viewable <a href='https://replit.com/@jasoncorn/faculty-grab#inputpath.py'>here</a>.

                2020 began a new life experience for me: working with people in a working environment.
                I began work at <a href='https://store.034motorsport.com/'><img class='workLogo' src='https://store.034motorsport.com/skin/frontend/motorsport/default/images/logo.png'></a> 
                in August of 2020 as a simple shop assistant. In a month,
                I was moved into a position as a shipping clerk. At this time, I was brand new in this area.
                With no previous experience with shipping items, I was determined to do my best. Within quite
                literally an hour or two, I had learned my entire way around my job: grabbing items off the shelf, 
                creating shipping labels using a brand new software called Sage, packaging the items,
                then sending it out.
            </span>
            <br>
            <span class='card-text'>
                Towards the end of my time with <a href='https://store.034motorsport.com/'><img class='workLogo' src='https://store.034motorsport.com/skin/frontend/motorsport/default/images/logo.png'></a> 
                , I was also asked to help
                with another portion of the shop. This portion was also completely unknown to me. I had never
                done machining in my life and never brought a thought to it previously. That did not stop me though.
                I learned what to do, why it does it, and how to do it efficiently in a quick manner. 
                This job is where my strongest abilities are outlined. Though I may not know much, 
                I am determined to learn and therefore very fast at learning.
